## What is JsonUI Scripting?

**JsonUI Scripting** is a [open-source](https://github.com/AsakiYuki/jsonui-scripting) framework designed to simplify the process of building JsonUI interfaces for **Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.**

With it, you can:

-   Use **JavaScript** or **TypeScript** to define your UI components in a reusable, clean, and logical way.
-   Write less boilerplate while gaining more structure and flexibility.
-   Integrate logic and expression evaluation directly through a custom **Binding Language**, which is **not available in native JsonUI**.

JsonUI Scripting introduces a DSL (domain-specific language) for writing complex UI logic, expressions, and conditionals with ease â€” including custom functions and built-in operators.

## How to use the Docs

The docs are divided into 3 main sections:

-   [Getting Started](/jsonui/getting-started):
    Learn how to install, set up, and create your first JsonUI Scripting project.
-   [JsonUI Scripting](/api-referencei):
    API reference of JsonUI Scripting
-   [JsonUI Binding](/jsonui/binding):
    Understand how the binding language works, available functions, expressions, and custom logic writing.

## Pre-requisite knowledge

Before diving into JsonUI Scripting, it is recommended that you're already familiar with:

-   [JsonUI](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/json-ui/json-ui-intro):
    basic usage, screen/component definitions
-   [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript):
    syntax, expressions, and basic function concepts
