## How It Works

JsonUI Scripting takes an **object-oriented programming (OOP)** approach to defining UI. Instead of writing raw JSON, you use JavaScript/TypeScript APIs to build UI structures that are easier to reuse and reason about.

Here’s a comparison between standard JSON-UI and JsonUI Scripting:

### JsonUI Scripting

```javascript
import { UI } from "jsonui-scripting"

UI.panel({
	size: "100%",
})
```

### JSON-UI

```json
{
	"a_panel": {
		"type": "panel",
		"size": ["100%", "100%"]
	},
	"namespace": "jsonui"
}
```

JsonUI Scripting automatically compiles your code into valid JsonUI format, making it compatible with Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. It also adds the benefit of abstraction, composition, and logic — features you can’t achieve directly with static JSON.

## Supported Element Types

JsonUI Scripting supports all standard JsonUI element types, which means anything you could build with JsonUI, you can build here — but with cleaner syntax and logic support.

-   **Containers**: `panel`, `stack_panel`, `collection_panel`, `grid`
-   **Text/Media**: `label`, `image`
-   **Inputs**: `input_panel`, `button`, `toggle`, `dropdown`, `slider`, `slider_box`, `edit_box`
-   **Scrolling**: `scroll_view`, `scrollbar_track`, `scrollbar_box`
-   **Interactive**: `screen`, `custom`
-   **Screens**: `screen`

You can use any of these element types as building blocks for your UI.

## Why Use JsonUI Scripting?

-   Write UI in **JavaScript** with logic, reusability, and structure
-   Avoid copy-pasting JSON blocks manually
-   Use variables, conditions, and binding expressions natively
-   Easier to **scale and maintain** large UI projects
